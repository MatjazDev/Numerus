### Still under development

At the moment the project is still under development since itâ€™s just a personal clean-coding experiment and exercise. You may follow the development phases on the [Numerus Trello board](https://trello.com/b/WtjZ94R3/numerus) which contains a lot of information.

Numerus aims to become a comprehensive tool to use roman numerals in every syntax form and rule, offering various tools of conversion and representation objects. Maybe one day will be even ported to C/C++, who knows.
